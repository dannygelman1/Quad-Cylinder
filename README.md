# Quad CylinderğŸ’ˆ 

When I was making my cake stand tool, I began writing code to make a quaded cylinder, so I decided to make a seperate tool just for that task. Users can control the height and radius of the cylinder, along with theÂ subdivision height, axis, and cap level. Throughout the changes, theÂ cylinder will remain quaded.Â
